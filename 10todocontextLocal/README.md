This project is Todo Web app made by using React + Vite . I have used localStorage for storing the information in browser.Data stored in localStorage is specific to the user's browser and is not shared across devices or browsers. Users will lose their tasks if they clear their browser storage.

#Context in React
Usually, you will pass information from a parent component to a child component via props. But passing props can become verbose and inconvenient if you have to pass them through many components in the middle, or if many components in your app need the same information. Context lets the parent component make some information available to any component in the tree below it—no matter how deep—without passing it explicitly through props.


Note : In place of Context  , Redux-Tool kit can also be used .
